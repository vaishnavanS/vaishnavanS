### 🛡️ I Build, Break, and Rebuild
I am a **Cybersecurity student & Full Stack Developer** with a passion for creating tools that bridge the gap between AI and security. My philosophy is simple: **Practical projects over theoretical knowledge.** I build systems that solve real-world problems and break them to understand how to make them unbreak-able.

- 🎓 **Education:** B.E. Computer Science (Cyber Security) @ Sri Shakthi Institute of Engineering and Technology (2024–2028)
- 🔭 **Currently focused on:** Advanced AI Safety, Automated Vulnerability Scanning, and Secure Full-Stack Architectures.
- ⚡ **Fun Fact:** I believe every line of code should have a purpose—either making a system faster or making it safer.
